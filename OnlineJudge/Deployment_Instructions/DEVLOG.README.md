1. Created an instance in the N.Virginia region. Did some googling and found out that it is better to initiate an instance in the Mumbai region. Hence, terminated the original instance. Made sure that no EBS volume was left in use.
2. Created another instance in the Mumbai region with the same configuration: T2 micro + Ubuntu OS + 16 GB SSD.
3. Cloned into GitHub repository.
4. Installed pip3, virtualenv and started a virtualenv named HackerJudge3.
5. Installed gunicorn using pip3. Installed nginx using apt-get. Cloned into ace-builds (for reference check the file supplied with this one for ace-builds configuration) (apt-get is used for installations used on the terminal. pip3 is used for downloading python import modules).
6. Added the public IP address of new EC2 instance in OnlineJudge/settings.py in Allowed_Hosts = ["my-ip"]
7. Configured nginx. (Imp: Set the user to root instead of www-data in /etc/nginx/nginx.conf otherwise it will never execute properly and permission errors will be persistent.) Simply copied the original file from previous instance into the new nginx configuration at /etc/nginx/sites-available and then linked the files (one for simple http connections and other for https connections (certbot needed for https)) to /etc/nginx/sites-enabled.
8. Installed docker by running "sudo snap install docker" and then got permissions error. For this, run "sudo chmod 666 /var/run/docker.sock". Then for running containers in daemon mode, run "docker run -dt --name cpp-container gcc" and "docker run -dt --name python-container python". This will pull the image as well as run it in daemon mode. This is essential step before running anything in docker in our system. Check once to see if the containers are running well by executing "docker ps". After this, there will still be an error saying our views.py cannot import docker. For this, just run "pip3 install docker". docker for python imports and docker for terminal are different.
9. After all this runs well, run "python3 manage.py collectstatic". Check once by running python3 manage.py runserver. If everything runs well there, check nginx configuration by running "sudo nginx -t". If it runs well, go for gunicorn by executing "cd /home/ubuntu/Online-Judge-Project/OnlineJudge/; gunicorn --reload --daemon --workers 3 --bind unix:/home/ubuntu/Online-Judge-Project/OnlineJudge/OnlineJudge.sock OnlineJudge.wsgi". Then run "sudo service nginx restart". After this, all that is left to do is check out the website on the internet. Go to http://my-ip/problems and check out the website.
10. If you encounter bugs after successful step 9, check error logs of nginx by "sudo nano /var/log/nginx/error.log" and access logs by checking "sudo nano /var/log/nginx/access.log". If that is fine, recheck the steps taken in step 7, 8, 9. Mostly all errors should be vanished by now.
11. Now, before using certbot, first step is to point the domain name to your website public ip address. Hence, add/change the type A record in the domain service provider. Set record type = A, hostname = ip_address_of_EC2_instance, ttl = whatever default value is there. If there is no CNAME record present for redirecting www.hackerjudge.in to hackerjudge.in, then make it as well.
12. All set to issue certificates from Let's Encrypt using certbot. The whole tutorial of certbot can be found here: https://certbot.eff.org/instructions?ws=nginx&os=ubuntufocal this is particularly for nginx on ubuntu 20 or higher. Precisely follow all instructions. When it asks for email, give the email and say yes/no for the following questions. When it asks for which domain you want the certificate for, type "hackerjudge.in, www.hackerjudge.in". The certificates will get issued shortly. If needed, in case the certificate is issued but not installed automatically in nginx configuration files, simply copy-paste from the nginx configuration file supplied with this MD file (which would be named hackerjudge2.in) and make a new file in the sites-available folder. Link it with the sites-enabled folder and delete the original default/normal http configuration file (if you don't delete it, it might cause problems.). 

This was the full tutorial for deploying Online Judge (Python Django based) website on AWS using Gunicorn, Nginx and certbot. Thank you.
